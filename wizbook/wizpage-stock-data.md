# Task Aim: Retrieve historical stock data for a given company for a specific period.

## Steps:
1. Navigate to a reliable financial website (e.g., Nasdaq.com, Google Finance).
2. Search for the company's ticker symbol in the search bar.
3. Navigate to the 'Historical Data' or 'Historical Quotes' section of the stock page.
4. Adjust the date range to the desired period (e.g., 3 months).
5. Download the historical data (if available) or extract it from the table/chart on the page.
6. Process the extracted data to meet the specific requirements (e.g., filter by date, format columns).

## Alternatives:
- **Google Finance:** Offers a clean interface and good for direct integration with Google Sheets. Search for the stock ticker and view the interactive chart.

## Notes:
- Nasdaq.com provides a download option for historical data, which is convenient for processing offline.
- When downloading data, verify the date range to ensure it matches the request. If the downloaded data covers a longer period, filter it programmatically.
- Always respect the website's terms of service and avoid excessive automated requests.
